The Chandra Snapshot provides a quick look of critical 
spacecraft components in realtime.

<hr>
Access
There are Primary and Backup versions of the Snapshot.
** Refer to <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/sot.html">SOT Home</a> for updated links.

Additionally, the first generation snapshot exists for reference at:
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/mta/snap.cgi">
http://cxc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/mta/snap.cgi</a>

There are also text-only copies of all three versions:
/pool14/chandra/chandra1.snapshot - primary
/pool14/chandra/chandra2.snapshot - backup
/pool14/chandra/chandra.snapshot  - first generation

<hr>
Sections (top to bottom)
- Current (as of last contact if LOS) time, Radiation Environment, Altitude
   f_ace: past 2-hour ACE fluence
   F_CRM: CRM orbital fluence on ACIS

- Current (as of last contact if LOS) spacecraft state

- browser buttons for access to last ~3 days' snapshots

- Current data - up-to-the-minute altitude and Radiation environment

<hr>
Color Scheme (not applicable for first generation snapshot)
Some state and limit checking is performed and indicated as follows:
- <font color=white>white</font> = unchecked
- <font color=#33CC00>green</font> = within limits/matches expected state
- <font color=#FFFF00>yellow</font> = warning limit/suspicious state
- <font color=#FF0000>red</font> = limit violation/does not match expected state
- <font color=#00EECC>blue</font> = unchecked (for quantities that are usually checked,
   for instance RA, Dec, and Roll may not be checked in NMAN mode,
   and Ephin rates are not checked in the Rad zones)
- <font color=#996677>purple</font> = stale data (value is more than 15 minutes old, usually means
   quantity is unavailable in current telemetry format)

<hr>
Violation Notification
